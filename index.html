                Hey there my name is Julia Rech! I'm 20 years old and I’m a 
                first year medical student at UNMDP University in Argentina. 
                I am currently living in Oregon while my classes are on hold for 
                the first 6 months of 2022. I consider myself fluent in Portuguese, 
                English and Spanish. I’m looking for some work to help me continue my 
                medical school. I work as a babysitter, dogsitter, and house cleaner. 
                Please use the contact form below to reach out to me and I will get 
                back to you ASAP via email!
